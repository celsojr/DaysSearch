## IntelliCode enum suggestion

### Steps to reproduce:

1. Code the first `switch case` logic;
1. Copy and paste the entire line (CRTL+C and CTRL+V);
1. Move the duplicated line to the next `switch case` (Alt + Arrow down) and you should see a suggestion for the others `cases`;
1. Now change the name of the column in the second `switch case` and at this moment you should see suggestions according to each case respecting the columns of the table of the same name as `enum`.
